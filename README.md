# What is Image Captioning ?

Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.
This task lies at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Most image captioning systems use an encoder-decoder framework, where an input image is encoded into an intermediate representation of the information in the image, and then decoded into a descriptive text sequence.

## To perform Image Captioning we will require two deep learning models combined into one for the training purpose

Computer vision can help in image captioning by extracting features from images that can be used to generate more accurate and informative captions.

CNNs extract the features from the image of some vector size aka the vector embeddings. The size of these embeddings depend on the type of pretrained network being used for the feature extraction

LSTMs are used for the text generation process. The image embeddings are concatenated with the word embeddings and passed to the LSTM to generate the next word

Deep learning models can be trained on large datasets of images and captions. This allows them to learn the statistical relationships between images and captions, which can help them to generate more accurate and informative captions.These models can be used to generate fluent, grammatically correct captions, and relevant to the image's content.

# For evaluating the performance:

BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric for evaluating the quality of machine-generated text. It is a measure of how similar the machine-generated text is to a set of human-generated reference translations.

BLEU is calculated by comparing the n-grams of the machine-generated text to the n-grams of the reference translations. An n-gram is a sequence of n consecutive words. BLEU takes into account the number of n-grams that match between the machine-generated text and the reference translations, as well as the order of the n-grams.

The BLEU score is a number between 0 and 1, with higher scores indicating better quality machine-generated text. A BLEU score of 1 indicates that the machine-generated text is identical to one of the reference translations.

BLEU is a widely used metric for evaluating machine translation systems, but it can also be used to evaluate other types of machine-generated text, such as image captions, summarization, and question answering.
## ISSUES RESOLVED :
# Data Preprocessing:
# Model Selection and Adaptation:
# Caption Generation and Style Infusion:
# Model Interpretability and Visualization:
# Multi-Modal Learning (Optional):
# Testing and Bug Fixes:Images with multiple objects:
Image captioning models often struggle to generate accurate captions for images with multiple objects. This is because the model may not be able to identify the most important object in the image or the relationships between the objects.
Images with complex backgrounds: Image captioning models can also struggle to generate accurate captions for images with complex backgrounds. This is because the model may not be able to distinguish between the foreground and background objects.
Images with unusual or rare objects: Image captioning models may not have been trained on images of unusual or rare objects. This can lead to inaccurate or nonsensical captions.
Images with abstract or artistic content: Image captioning models can also struggle to generate accurate captions for images with abstract or artistic content. This is because the model may not be able to understand the meaning of the image.
# Performance Benchmarking:
by using BART is a large language model that has been trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It has been shown to be very effective for a variety of natural language processing tasks, including image captioning.
Also by using ViLBERT is a vision-and-language model that has been trained on a dataset of images and text. It is able to learn the relationships between images and text, which helps it to generate more accurate and informative captions.
