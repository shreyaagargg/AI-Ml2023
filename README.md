# Problem Statement: Retrofuturistic Image Captioning

**Welcome to the Retrofuturistic Image Captioning project!** In this open-source initiative, we invite participants to tackle the challenge of **infusing retrofuturistic storytelling style into image captions generated by machine learning models**. This project combines the fields of computer vision and natural language processing to create captivating and immersive narratives for images that evoke a sense of nostalgia for futuristic visions of the past.

## How to Participate

- For **complete beginners**, we invite participants to try their hands at image caption generation in general, while experienced participants can experiment more with retrofuturistic image caption generation. **Beginners are advised to attempt all questions with a general approach, and if comfortable, start with the retrofuturistic captioning.**
- Participants are advised to attempt as many challenges as possible in the given time period.
- If participants attempt retrofuturistic captioning, they become eligible for bonus points ;)
- Optional challenges also count for bonus points!

## Objective

Develop and refine machine learning models capable of generating image captions in a retrofuturistic storytelling style, where images from the COCO dataset (or any other suitable dataset) are described with captivating language reminiscent of a bygone era's futuristic imagination.

## Deliverables

- Jupyter notebook of your complete machine learning model that generates retrofuturistic-style image captions.
- A project report summarizing the methodology, findings and model accuracy.
- Optionally, a user-friendly interface for interactive caption generation.
- A video to demonstrate the working or testing of the final product built.

## Datasets:

- [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home)
- [Flickr 8k Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shadabhussain/flickr8k)
- Come up with your own dataset! This could involve web scraping or manually collecting images and then labelling them

## Questions and Challenges for Participants

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - How will you handle missing image or caption data in the COCO dataset?
   - Can you implement data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data?

2. **Model Selection and Adaptation:**
   - Which pre-trained image encoder (e.g., ResNet, VGG) will you use as the starting point for your model?
   - How will you handle variable-length captions during training?

3. **Caption Generation and Style Infusion:**
   - What techniques or approaches will you use to infuse a retrofuturistic style into the generated captions?
   - Can you provide examples of how the model's captions differ from a standard image captioning model?

4. **Evaluation Metrics and Automation:**
   - How will you automate the evaluation process on test data?

5. **Fine-Tuning for Retrofuturistic Style:**
   - What methods will you employ to create a custom dataset with retrofuturistic captions for fine-tuning?

6. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
   - Which hyperparameters will you tune, and what ranges or techniques will you use for optimization?

7. **Model Interpretability and Visualization:**
   - Can you identify any patterns or insights in how the model generates retrofuturistic captions?

8. **Multi-Modal Learning (Optional):**
   - If implementing multi-modal capabilities, how will you combine image and text information for captioning?
   - Are there any unique challenges in generating retrofuturistic captions for multi-modal inputs?

9. **User Interface (Optional):**
   - What technologies or frameworks will you use to create the user interface?
   - How will users interact with the model to receive retrofuturistic captions?

10. **Testing and Bug Fixes:**
    - Are there any specific edge cases or scenarios that need special attention?

11. **Performance Benchmarking:**
    - Which state-of-the-art image captioning models will you compare your retrofuturistic model against?
    - What metrics and datasets will you use for benchmarking?
